# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-20

First release. Sessionboxer runs coding agents (Claude Code, Devin) in one Docker Sandbox per
session, each with its own desktop, terminal, editor and browser, managed from a web UI that
also works on a phone.

Install: `npx sessionboxer@0.1.0 serve`, or `docker compose up` with the `docker-compose.yml`
from this release, or `curl -fsSL https://sessionboxer.talayolabs.com/install.sh | sh`. The
Sandbox image `ghcr.io/talayolabs/sessionboxer-sandbox:0.1.0` (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) is
pulled on first use.

### Sessions and Sandboxes
- One Docker Sandbox per session (Ubuntu 24.04 desktop: Xvfb, XFCE, Firefox, noVNC), agent runs
  inside it; workspaces from a git URL, a copied host folder, or empty; CPU/memory limits.
- Claude Code (subscription via OAuth token or API key/base URL) and Devin CLI, both over ACP;
  model and agent-option pickers; per-session instructions.
- Snapshots after each turn and on demand; fork a session from any snapshot; branches with
  revert/switch; stop/resume with the conversation replayed.
- Docker inside the Sandbox (Sysbox when available, privileged fallback, or off).
- Saved messages and a send queue; attachments (images, files) in prompts.

### Panes
- Chat with inline screenshots, tool calls, videos/images/PDFs the agent produced, clickable
  file paths that open in the Code pane.
- Desktop (noVNC), Terminal (xterm.js), Code (VS Code in the browser), Context (usage gauge,
  compactions, exact LLM requests/responses when inspection is on), PRs (comments and reviews
  of attached pull requests, with "address and reply" actions).
- Recordings with captions and narration from the agent's `start_recording`/`annotate_recording`.

### Integrations
- MCP server registry with per-session activation and secret injection; GitHub login (device
  flow or existing `gh`) forwarded into the Sandbox as `gh`/git credentials; git identity.
- Pull request polling and notifications.

### Remote access
- Access token + per-device cookies in front of everything; QR pairing for phones.
- Pair another device over: the local network, an embedded Cloudflare quick tunnel, the
  Sessionboxer tunnel (frp at tunnel-sessionboxer.talayolabs.com, stable subdomain, verified
  TLS), or your own server over SSH.
- Phone layout, installable PWA, Web Push for "turn ended" and PR feedback.
- Trusts this machine's CA certificates (Cloudflare WARP, corporate proxies) for its own
  downloads and inside Sandboxes.

### Distribution
- `sessionboxer` on npm (Control Plane, web UI and CLI in one package).
- `ghcr.io/talayolabs/sessionboxer` (Control Plane) and `ghcr.io/talayolabs/sessionboxer-sandbox`
  images for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64; `docker-compose.yml`.
- `npm run build:image` still builds the Sandbox image locally for development.
